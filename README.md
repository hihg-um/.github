# Challenges in Research Computing

Researchers engaging in data analysis, can frequently be overwhelmend with compute-cost-projection models, that are far removed in latency from beginnings of realistically funded opportunities to find ways to more efficiently expolore out ever-growing data lake. 

Data Analysis: Primary Categorizes

1. Data (Restricted)
2. Configuration / Meta-Date: (Private): where are the data and how are they indexed)
3. Code: (Public): what operations were performed on the data in (1) to achieve the result (4)
